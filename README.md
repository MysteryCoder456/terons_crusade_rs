[Teron's Crusade](https://github.com/MysteryCoder456/Terons-Crusade)... but in Rust?

## Why rewrite in Rust?

Because Rust is cool, and makes me feel smart :).
Jokes aside, the original project was abandoned some time ago and I've always wanted to finish it someday.
Rewriting it in Rust seemed like a good exercise and excuse to learn Rust and the Bevy game engine.
